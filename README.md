# Healthcare-resource-allocation-for-disease-outbreaks
This GitHub repository hosts code and resources related to healthcare resource allocation strategies for managing disease outbreaks. The code in this repository covers hierarchical clustering, k-means, spectral clustering, and DBSCAN applied to state-level and country-level datasets obtained from government websites. 

## Project Overview
This repository contains code and resources related to healthcare resource allocation strategies for managing disease outbreaks. The code includes implementations of hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, spectral clustering, and DBSCAN applied to state-level and country-level datasets obtained from government websites. Our goal is to provide data-driven tools and insights to assist healthcare professionals and policymakers during disease outbreaks.

## Data Sources
- State and country datasets are sourced from government websites.
- [Link to State Dataset](https://data.gov.in/)
- [Link to Country Dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/)

## Code Files
The repository includes the following main code files:
- `hierarchical clustering`: Code for hierarchical clustering analysis.
- `k-means`: Code for k-means clustering analysis.
- `spectral clustering`: Code for spectral clustering analysis.
- `dbscan`: Code for DBSCAN clustering analysis.
- `datasets`: datasets repo.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the respective clustering code files with your dataset as input.
3. Analyze the results to make data-driven decisions in healthcare resource allocation during disease outbreaks.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset underwent the following preprocessing steps:
- Data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
- Feature selection and transformation for clustering analysis.

## Results
Key findings and insights from the clustering analyses are as follows:
- Include important discoveries, trends, or patterns revealed by your analysis.
- Share visualizations or summary statistics to support your results.
